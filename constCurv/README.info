This folder contains several functions, images (geotiff files),
and script files, as well as two folders (resdata, summplots)
containing the results from running the main script files. 

These functions serve to evolve an image using level surface
methods --- this is done in mapLRunEvoLS.m, which calls
evoLS_reinit to first reinitialize the original image, and then
evoLS_curvature to evolve the level surface in three space (or
higher). These functions make use of the LStoolbox library (found
in ../Kernel). 

The results of mapLRunEvoLS are stored in resdata, and the names
of the files correspond with parameter value iterations. These
.mat files contain a string variable storing a description of the
other contents of that .mat file, one or two matrix objects that
store the evolved level surface, and the original level surface,
and a struct object which stores information about the
domain. More detailed information about the domain can be obtained
by importing (using geotiffread on supporting versions of MATLAB)
the appropriate (etopo1Large.tif) geotiff file and looking at the
corresponding geoRaster object (geoR). Note that an abridged
version of this information is contained in the struct object
found in geoR.mat (information sufficient to generate the domain
information, but perhaps not detailed information for
re-generating a realistic map?). 

The files in resdata are loaded by summarizeResData.m, which then
calls evoLSPlotSummary to generate a (somewhat) detailed summary
of the information contained in each .mat file. Namely, it
generates a plot of the zero isocontour of d_curv (this object
being one of the matrices that is found in the correpsonding .mat
file) by default; however, editing this file can allow generation
of 2- and 3D quiver plots that use quiver to show the normal
direction to the level surface at points that are close to the
zero isocontour (unfortunately, these plots don't look so great,
because the arrows are plotted too densely, in addition to the
fact that there is very little horizontal variation [i.e., most of
the arrows points vertically]). The output files generated by each
run of evoLSPlotSummary are stored in the directory summplots.
