These (13) files were created by running mapLRunEvoLS.m, which
calls evoLS_curvature and evoLS_reinit on a geotiff file, to
evolve a level surface representation of bathymetry data of the
Earth. The file names correspond with the paramter values that
were varied over the course of the runs. 

Generally, it was found that a higher b value and longer duration
improved the final outcome of the map (with respect to effective
smoothing of small details, while preserving [with relative
accuracy] the shape of larger features).
